Yet Another Pixel Dungeon
=======================

A mobile roguelike RPG, based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon, by Watabou. Main differences from original game are:

* Significant rework of combat, stealth, healing and wand mechanics!
 
* Total rework/rebalancing of weapons, armors, potions, scrolls, wands, rings, mobs, and classes.
 
* Dual wielding, shields, ranged weapons and different categories of armors.
 
* Dungeon is now 31 floors deep, with every chapter consisting of 6 floors instead of 5.
 
* Many mobs were moved to other chapters and most of their abilities were changed.
 
* Shops are on every fifth level now, and they have much more useful things for sale!
 
* Environment now affects your stealth and evasion, rewarding careful positioning.
 
* Armor enchantments do not have any real drawbacks anymore, and are fully reworked.
 
* Fully reworked battle with first and fourth bosses (rework of other bosses is coming later).
 
* Gameplay tips on loading screen and more detailed info about items and stats.
 
* Improved interface - auto-aiming, extended journal, better inventory and more!

Yet Another Pixel Dungeon uses gradle and is most easily compiled/edited using Android Studio.
